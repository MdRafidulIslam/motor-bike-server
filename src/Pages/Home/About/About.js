        The origin of the word "MotorBike" is most likely lost to history. The
        term "MotorBike" may originate from the Old French word travail, which
        means 'work'.[2] According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first
        known use of the word MotorBikewas in the 14th century. It also states
        that the word comes from Middle English MotorBike,MotorBike (which means
        to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French
        travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil). The origin of the

        Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words
        MotorBike and travail both share an even more ancient root: a Roman
        instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three
        stakes", as in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty
        of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or may not be
